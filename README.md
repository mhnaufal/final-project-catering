# GenGIGIH Final Project | Catering

This repository is suppose to be the repo for my implementation of GenGIGIH final project

### Author

### Developement

### Useful Commands

#### Rails

```ruby
rails generate controller name
```

#### Sqlite3

See all tables

```sql
.tables
```

Describe a table

```sql
.mode markdown
pragma table_info('table name')
```

#### Etc

- **create** saved the instance into database while **build** only saved it on memory

- Use **create** in controllers because the controllers need to do a query into a database

- I use Ruby version 3.1.1 locally via Windows + VSCode, but in Replit the only available Ruby version is 3.0.3, so kindly check the Ruby version in the Gemfile and change it to 3.0.3 if needed üòÅ

### Credits

Thanks to [Generasi GIGIH 2.0](https://www.anakbangsabisa.org/generasi-gigih/) for providing me with a such wonderful journey

Extra note = I use branch **develop** as the place where the history of commits exist
